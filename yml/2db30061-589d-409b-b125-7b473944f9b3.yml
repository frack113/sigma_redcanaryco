Attack_name: Build Image on Host
Attack_description: "Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. A remote <code>build</code>\
  \ request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.(Citation: Docker\
  \ Build Image)\n\nAn adversary may take advantage of that <code>build</code> API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize\
  \ [Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610) using that custom image.(Citation: Aqua Build Images on Hosts)(Citation: Aqua Security Cloud Native Threat Report June 2021) If the base\
  \ image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since itâ€™s a vanilla image. If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered\
  \ even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment. "
