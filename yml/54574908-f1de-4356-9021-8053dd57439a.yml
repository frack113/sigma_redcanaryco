Attack_description: "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information\
  \ include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system. \n\nWithin cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts. Additionally,\
  \ if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running on non-cloud systems as well."
