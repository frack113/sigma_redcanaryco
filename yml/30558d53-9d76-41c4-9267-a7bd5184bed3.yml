Attack_name: Internal Defacement
Attack_description: 'An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users. This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to
  user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster) Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001)
  in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages. Since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary''s presence, it often takes place after other intrusion
  goals have been accomplished.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)'
