Attack_name: Resource Hijacking
Attack_description: "Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems in order to solve resource intensive problems which may impact system and/or hosted service availability. \n\nOne common purpose\
  \ for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines\
  \ to become unresponsive.(Citation: Kaspersky Lazarus Under The Hood Blog 2017) Servers and cloud-based(Citation: CloudSploit - Unused AWS Regions) systems are common targets because of the high potential\
  \ for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining. Containerized environments may also be targeted due to the ease\
  \ of deployment via exposed APIs and the potential for scaling mining activities by deploying or compromising multiple containers within an environment or cluster.(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)(Citation:\
  \ Trend Micro Exposed Docker APIs)\n\nAdditionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware kills off processes for competing malware to ensure itâ€™s not competing for resources.(Citation: Trend Micro War of\
  \ Crypto Miners)"
