Attack_name: 'Account Discovery: Domain Account'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which domain accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior such as targeting\
  \ specific accounts which possess particular privileges.\n\nCommands such as <code>net user /domain</code> and <code>net group /domain</code> of the [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) utility,\
  \ <code>dscacheutil -q group</code>on macOS, and <code>ldapsearch</code> on Linux can list domain users and groups. [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlets including <code>Get-ADUser</code>\
  \ and <code>Get-ADGroupMember</code> may enumerate members of Active Directory groups.  "
