Attack_name: 'Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts'
Attack_description: "Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those
  created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely
  in the cloud or be hybrid joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory. (Citation: AWS Identity Federation)(Citation:
  Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying AD Federation)\n\nService or user accounts may be targeted by adversaries through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566),
  or various other means to gain access to the environment. Federated accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems and cloud environments.\n\nAn adversary may create long
  lasting [Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) on a compromised cloud account to maintain persistence in the environment. Such credentials may also be used to bypass
  security controls such as multi-factor authentication. \n\nCloud accounts may also be able to assume [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005) or other privileges
  through various means within the environment. Misconfigurations in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to use these mechanisms to leverage permissions outside the intended
  scope of the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive data from online storage accounts and databases through [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)
  or other methods. \n"

description: "This atomic will create a new IAM role. The default role permissions are: *IAM Service Account Get*. The idea for this Atomic came from a Rule published by the Elastic team.\n\nIdentifies
  an Identity and Access Management (IAM) custom role creation in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). \nCustom roles are user-defined, and allow for the bundling of one or more supported permissions to meet specific
  needs. \nCustom roles will not be updated automatically and could lead to privilege creep if not carefully scrutinized.\n\nThis atomic will create a new IAM role. The default role permissions are: *IAM
  Service Account Get*\n\nReference: https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/integrations/gcp/initial_access_gcp_iam_custom_role_creation.toml\n"
