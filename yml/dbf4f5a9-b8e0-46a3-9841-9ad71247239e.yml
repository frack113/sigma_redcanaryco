Attack_name: Create Process with Token
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> and <code>runas</code>.(Citation: Microsoft RunAs)

  Creating processes with a token not associated with the current user may require the credentials of the target user, specific privileges to impersonate that user, or access to the token to be used. For example, the token could be duplicated via [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) or created via [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003) before being used to create a process.

  While this technique is distinct from [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001), the techniques can be used in conjunction where a token is duplicated and then used to create a new process.

description: "This Action demonstrates how an access token for a specific program can spawn another program under a different owner. \nAdversaries can leverage access tokens to run programs under a different\
  \ user not only to achieve privilege escalation but also to evade detection by blending in with normal user activity. \nThis Action will query all processes and list the process name and owner.It will\
  \ then make a copy of an existing token to create a new instance of cmd.exe\n"
