Attack_name: Account Manipulation
Attack_description: "Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to
  a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password
  updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. \n\nIn order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on
  systems or the domain. However, account manipulation may also lead to privilege escalation where modifications grant access to additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)."

name: Azure AD - adding permission to application
tactic:
  - persistence
  - privilege-escalation
technique:
  - T1098
os:
  - azure-ad
description: |
  The adversaries want to add permission to newly created application. Application could be then used for persistence or for further operation in the attacked infrastructure. Permissions like AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All or RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory in particular can be a valuable target for a threat actor.
  This technique will create a new app, with the provided name, and give it the provided permission. But if you prefer to add credentials to an existing app, replace in the code: "Get-AzureADApplication" instead of "New-AzureADServicePrincipal".
  The DirectoryRecommendations.Read.All permissions has been selected as the default.

  The account you use to run the PowerShell command should have Global Administrator/Application Administrator/Cloud Application Administrator role in your Azure AD.

  Detection hint - check Operation Name "Add app role assignment to service principal" in subscriptions Activity Logs.
