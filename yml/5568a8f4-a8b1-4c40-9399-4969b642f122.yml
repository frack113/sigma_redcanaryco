Attack_name: Exfiltration Over Web Service
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.

  Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.
