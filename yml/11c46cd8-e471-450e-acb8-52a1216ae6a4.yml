Attack_name: Software Packing
Attack_description: "Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing\
  \ an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection\
  \ translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.(Citation: ESET FinFisher Jan 2018) \n\n\
  Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing\
  \ techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.(Citation: Awesome Executable Packing)  "

  Copies and then runs a simple binary (just outputting "the cake is a lie"), that was packed by UPX.
  No other protection/compression were applied.
