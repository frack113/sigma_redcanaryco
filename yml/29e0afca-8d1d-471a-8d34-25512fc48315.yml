Attack_name: Time Providers
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.(Citation: Microsoft W32Time Feb 2018) W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

  Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of  <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\</code>.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider) The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

  Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish persistence, specifically by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account.(Citation: Github W32Time Oct 2017)
guid: 29e0afca-8d1d-471a-8d34-25512fc48315
name: Edit an existing time provider
tactic:
  - persistence
  - privilege-escalation
technique:
  - T1547.003
os:
  - windows
description: |
  Establishes persistence by editing the NtpServer time provider registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProvider.
  The time provider will point to a DLL which will be loaded after the w32time service is started. The DLL will then create the file AtomicTest.txt
  in C:\Users\Public\ as validation that the test is successful.
