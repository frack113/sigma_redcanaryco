Attack_name: Remote System Discovery
Attack_description: "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system.\
  \ Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as  [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or <code>net\
  \ view</code> using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Adversaries may also use local host files (ex: <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts</code> or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) in\
  \ order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. \n"
