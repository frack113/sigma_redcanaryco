Attack_name: Windows Management Instrumentation
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to achieve execution. WMI is a Windows administration feature that provides a uniform environment for local and remote access to Windows system components. It relies on the WMI service for local and remote access and the server message block (SMB) (Citation: Wikipedia SMB) and Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) (Citation: TechNet RPC) for remote access. RPCS operates over port 135. (Citation: MSDN WMI)

  An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to perform many tactic functions, such as gathering information for Discovery and remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. (Citation: FireEye WMI SANS 2015) (Citation: FireEye WMI 2015)

description: "An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain Remote Service is running on a remote device. \nWhen the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.\n\
  A common feedback message is that \"No instance(s) Available\" if the service queried is not running.\nA common error message is \"Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is\
