Attack_description: "Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the\
  \ victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095). Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools\
  \ between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)). \n\nFiles can also be transferred using various [Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)s\
  \ as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.(Citation: PTSecurity Cobalt Dec 2016)\n\nOn Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as `copy`, `finger`,\
  \ and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) commands such as <code>IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString()</code> and <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>. On Linux and macOS systems,\
  \ a variety of utilities also exist, such as `curl`, `scp`, `sftp`, `tftp`, `rsync`, `finger`, and `wget`.(Citation: t1105_lolbas)"
