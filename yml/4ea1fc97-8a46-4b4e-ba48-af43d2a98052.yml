Attack_name: 'User Execution: Malicious File'
Attack_description: "An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code\
  \ execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001). Adversaries may use several types of files\
  \ that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.\n\nAdversaries may employ various forms of [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)\
  \ and [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to increase the likelihood that a user will open and successfully execute a malicious file. These methods may include\
  \ using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the file and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it.(Citation: Password Protected Word Docs) \n\nWhile [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)\
  \ frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will\
  \ click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)."

name: Excel 4 Macro
tactic:
  - execution
technique:
  - T1204.002
os:
  - windows
description: |
  This module creates an Excel 4 Macro (XLM) enabled spreadsheet and executes it. The XLM will first write a "malicious"
  VBS file to %TEMP%, then execute this file. The VBS will download Process Explorer to the same directory (%TEMP%) and exec.

  A note regarding this module. By default, this module will pull the current username from the system and places it into the macro. If
  you'd like to utilize the "=GET.WORKSPACE(26)" method, that many maldoc authors use, you will need to ensure that the User Name associated
  with Excel matches that of the local system. This username can be found under Files -> Options -> Username
