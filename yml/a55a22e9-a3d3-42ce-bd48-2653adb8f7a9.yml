Attack_name: Account Manipulation
Attack_description: "Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such
  as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password
  duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. \n\nIn order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain. However,
  account manipulation may also lead to privilege escalation where modifications grant access to additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)."

description: "Create a random atr-nnnnnnnn account and add it to a domain group (by default, Domain Admins). \n\nThe quickest way to run it is against a domain controller, using `-Session` of `Invoke-AtomicTest`.
  Alternatively,\nyou need to install PS Module ActiveDirectory (in prereqs) and run the script with appropriare AD privileges to \ncreate the user and alter the group. Automatic installation of the dependency
  requires an elevated session, \nand is unlikely to work with Powershell Core (untested).\n\nIf you consider running this test against a production Active Directory, the good practise is to create a dedicated\n
  service account whose delegation is given onto a dedicated OU for user creation and deletion, as well as delegated\nas group manager of the target group.\n\nExample: `Invoke-AtomicTest -Session $session
  'T1098' -TestNames \"Domain Account and Group Manipulate\" -InputArgs @{\"group\" = \"DNSAdmins\" }`\n"
