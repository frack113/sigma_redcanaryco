Attack_name: 'Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model Hijacking'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a system within Windows to enable\
  \ interaction between software components through the operating system.(Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model)  References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry. \n\nAdversaries can use\
  \ the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence. Hijacking a COM object\
  \ requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed. When that system component is executed through normal\
  \ system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.(Citation: GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level\
  \ of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection. "

name: COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch)
tactic:
  - privilege-escalation
  - persistence
technique:
  - T1546.015
os:
  - windows
description: "This test uses PowerShell to hijack a reference to a Component Object Model by creating registry values under InprocServer32 key in the HKCU hive then calling the Class ID to be executed via\
  \ \"rundll32.exe -localserver [clsid]\". \nThis method is generally used as an alternative to 'rundll32.exe -sta [clsid]' to execute dll's while evading detection. \nReference: https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2020/02/13/run-lola-bin-run/\n\
  Upon successful execution of this test with the default options, whenever certain apps are opened (for example, Notepad), a calculator window will also be opened. "
