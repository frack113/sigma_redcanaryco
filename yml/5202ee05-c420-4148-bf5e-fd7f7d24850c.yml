Attack_name: 'User Execution: Malicious File'
Attack_description: "An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code\
  \ execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001). Adversaries may use several types of files\
  \ that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.\n\nAdversaries may employ various forms of [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)\
  \ and [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to increase the likelihood that a user will open and successfully execute a malicious file. These methods may include\
  \ using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the file and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it.(Citation: Password Protected Word Docs) \n\nWhile [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)\
  \ frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will\
  \ click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)."

  This Test uses a VBA macro to launch Powershell which will download a file from a user defined web server.
  Required input agruments are c2_domain and file_name
  Execution is handled by [Invoke-MalDoc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1) to load and execute VBA code into Excel or Word documents.
  Example for c2 server located at 127.0.0.1 for the file test.txt which is nested below the parent directory in the tests/my-test folder
  Example input args for file in root directory c2-domain = 127.0.0.1, file-name = test.txt
