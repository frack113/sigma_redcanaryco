Attack_name: Security Account Manager
Attack_description: "Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the\
  \ SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the <code>net user</code> command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM\
  \ level access.\n\nA number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:\n\n* pwdumpx.exe\n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n\
  * secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:\n\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\sam sam</code>\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\system system</code>\n\nCreddump7 can then be used\
  \ to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.(Citation: GitHub Creddump7)\n\nNotes: \n* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.\n* RID 501 is the guest account.\n* User accounts\
  \ start with a RID of 1,000+.\n"

name: Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets
tactic:
  - credential-access
technique:
  - T1003.002
os:
  - windows
description: |
  Local SAM (SAM & System), cached credentials (System & Security) and LSA secrets (System & Security) can be enumerated
  via three registry keys. Then processed locally using https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7

  Upon successful execution of this test, you will find three files named, sam, system and security in the %temp% directory.
