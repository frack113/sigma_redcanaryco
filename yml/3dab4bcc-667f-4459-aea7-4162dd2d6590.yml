Attack_name: Data from Cloud Storage Object
Attack_description: "Adversaries may access data from improperly secured cloud storage.\n\nMany cloud service providers offer solutions for online data object storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and\
  \ Google Cloud Storage. These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application. Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly\
  \ using the cloud provider's APIs. \n\nIn other cases, SaaS application providers such as Slack, Confluence, and Salesforce also provide cloud storage solutions as a peripheral use case of their platform.\
  \ These cloud objects can be extracted directly from their associated application.(Citation: EA Hacked via Slack - June 2021)(Citation: SecureWorld - How Secure Is Your Slack Channel - Dec 2021)(Citation:\
  \ HackerNews - 3 SaaS App Cyber Attacks - April 2022)(Citation: Dark Clouds_Usenix_Mulazzani_08_2011)\n\nAdversaries may collect sensitive data from these cloud storage solutions. Providers typically\
  \ offer security guides to help end users configure systems, though misconfigurations are a common problem.(Citation: Amazon S3 Security, 2019)(Citation: Microsoft Azure Storage Security, 2019)(Citation:\
  \ Google Cloud Storage Best Practices, 2019) There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing public access to unauthenticated\
  \ users, overly-broad access by all users, or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity Access Management system without even needing basic user permissions.\n\nThis open\
  \ access may expose various types of sensitive data, such as credit cards, personally identifiable information, or medical records.(Citation: Trend Micro S3 Exposed PII, 2017)(Citation: Wired Magecart\
  \ S3 Buckets, 2019)(Citation: HIPAA Journal S3 Breach, 2017)(Citation: Rclone-mega-extortion_05_2021)\n\nAdversaries may also obtain then abuse leaked credentials from source repositories, logs, or other\
  \ means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects."
