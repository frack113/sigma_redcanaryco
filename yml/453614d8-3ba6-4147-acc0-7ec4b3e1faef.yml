Attack_name: Compile After Delivery
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries. These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.(Citation: ClearSky MuddyWater Nov 2018)

  Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Payloads may also be delivered in formats unrecognizable and inherently benign to the native OS (ex: EXEs on macOS/Linux) before later being (re)compiled into a proper executable binary with a bundled compiler and execution framework.(Citation: TrendMicro WindowsAppMac)

  - windows
description: "When C# is compiled dynamically, a .cmdline file will be created as a part of the process. \nCertain processes are not typically observed compiling C# code, but can do so without touching\
  \ disk. This can be used to unpack a payload for execution.\nThe exe file that will be executed is named as T1027.004_DynamicCompile.exe is containted in the 'bin' folder of this atomic, and the source\
  \ code to the file is in the 'src' folder.\nUpon execution, the exe will print 'T1027.004 Dynamic Compile'.\n"
