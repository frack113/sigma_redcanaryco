Attack_name: Disable or Modify System Firewall
Attack_description: "Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or\
  \ modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.\n\nModifying or disabling\
  \ a system firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed. "
