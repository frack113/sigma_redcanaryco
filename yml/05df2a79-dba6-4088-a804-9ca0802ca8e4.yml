Attack_name: Network Service Discovery
Attack_description: "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation.
  Common methods to acquire this information include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.(Citation: CISA AR21-126A FIVEHANDS May 2021)   \n\nWithin cloud environments,
  adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts. Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services
  running on non-cloud systems as well.\n\nWithin macOS environments, adversaries may use the native Bonjour application to discover services running on other macOS hosts within a network. The Bonjour mDNSResponder
  daemon automatically registers and advertises a hostâ€™s registered services on the network. For example, adversaries can use a mDNS query (such as <code>dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp .</code>) to find other systems
  broadcasting the ssh service.(Citation: apple doco bonjour description)(Citation: macOS APT Activity Bradley)"

description: |
  Scanning common ports in a /24 subnet. If no IP address for the target subnet is specified the test tries to determine the attacking machine's "primary" IPv4 address first and then scans that address with a /24 netmask.
  The connection attempts to use a timeout parameter in milliseconds to speed up the scan. Please note the atomic might not print any output until the scans are completed.
