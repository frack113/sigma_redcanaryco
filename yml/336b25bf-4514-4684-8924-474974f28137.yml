Attack_name: 'Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication,
  encryption/decryption, and digital signatures.(Citation: Wikipedia Public Key Crypto) Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc. \n
  \nAdversaries may also look in common key directories, such as <code>~/.ssh</code> for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or <code>C:&#92;Users&#92;(username)&#92;.ssh&#92;</code> on Windows. Adversary tools
  may also search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.(Citation: Kaspersky Careto)(Citation: Palo Alto Prince of Persia)\n\nWhen a device is registered
  to Azure AD, a device key and a transport key are generated and used to verify the deviceâ€™s identity.(Citation: Microsoft Primary Refresh Token) An adversary with access to the device may be able to export
  the keys in order to impersonate the device.(Citation: AADInternals Azure AD Device Identities)\n\nOn network devices, private keys may be exported via [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)
  commands such as `crypto pki export`.(Citation: cisco_deploy_rsa_keys) \n\nSome private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)
  for keylogging or attempt to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) the passphrase off-line. These private keys can be used to authenticate to [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
  like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email."

name: CertUtil ExportPFX
tactic:
  - credential-access
technique:
  - T1552.004
os:
  - windows
description: |
  The following Atomic test simulates adding a generic non-malicious certificate to the Root certificate store. This behavior generates a registry modification that adds the cloned root CA certificate in the keys outlined in the blog. In addition, this Atomic utilizes CertUtil to export the PFX (ExportPFX), similar to what was seen in the Golden SAML attack.
  Keys will look like - \SystemCertificates\CA\Certificates or \SystemCertificates\Root\Certificates
