Attack_name: 'Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the\
  \ remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. \n\nProtocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that carry web traffic may be\
  \ very common in environments. HTTP/S packets have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed. An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within\
  \ a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic. "
