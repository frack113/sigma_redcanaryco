  \ between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)). \n\nFiles can also be transferred using various [Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)s\
  \ as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.(Citation: PTSecurity Cobalt Dec 2016)\n\nOn Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as `copy`, `finger`,\
  \ [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160), and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) commands such as <code>IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString()</code> and\
