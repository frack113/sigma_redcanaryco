Attack_name: 'Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel. Cloud storage services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval\
  \ of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.\n\nExamples of cloud storage services include Dropbox and Google Docs. Exfiltration to these cloud storage services can provide a significant\
  \ amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service. "
