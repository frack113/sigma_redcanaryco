Attack_name: NTDS
Attack_description: |
  Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights. By default, the NTDS file (NTDS.dit) is located in <code>%SystemRoot%\NTDS\Ntds.dit</code> of a domain controller.(Citation: Wikipedia Active Directory)

  In addition to looking for NTDS files on active Domain Controllers, adversaries may search for backups that contain the same or similar information.(Citation: Metcalf 2015)

  The following tools and techniques can be used to enumerate the NTDS file and the contents of the entire Active Directory hashes.

  * Volume Shadow Copy
  * secretsdump.py
  * Using the in-built Windows tool, ntdsutil.exe
  * Invoke-NinjaCopy

  This test is intended to be run on a domain Controller.

  The Active Directory database NTDS.dit may be dumped by copying it from a Volume Shadow Copy.

  This test requires steps taken in the test "Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin".
  A successful test also requires the export of the SYSTEM Registry hive.
  This test must be executed on a Windows Domain Controller.
