Attack_name: 'Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall'
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.

  Modifying or disabling a system firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed. For example, adversaries may add a new firewall rule for a well-known protocol (such as RDP) using a non-traditional and potentially less securitized port (i.e. [Non-Standard Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)).(Citation: change_rdp_port_conti)

description: "Some Linux systems may not activate ufw, but use iptables for firewall rules instead. (ufw works on top of iptables.) \nAttackers cannot directly disable iptables, as it is not implemented\
  \ as a service like ufw. But they can flush all iptables \nrules, which in fact \"disable\" iptables. \n"
