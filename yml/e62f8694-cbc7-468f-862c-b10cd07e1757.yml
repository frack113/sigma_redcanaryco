Attack_name: 'Indicator Removal on Host: Clear FreeBSD, Linux or Mac System Logs'
Attack_description: |
  Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs. The majority of native system logging is stored under the <code>/var/log/</code> directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:(Citation: Linux Logs)

  * <code>/var/log/messages:</code>: General and system-related messages
  * <code>/var/log/secure</code> or <code>/var/log/auth.log</code>: Authentication logs
  * <code>/var/log/utmp</code> or <code>/var/log/wtmp</code>: Login records
  * <code>/var/log/kern.log</code>: Kernel logs
  * <code>/var/log/cron.log</code>: Crond logs
  * <code>/var/log/maillog</code>: Mail server logs
  * <code>/var/log/httpd/</code>: Web server access and error logs
