Attack_name: 'Impair Defenses: Disable Cloud Logs'
Attack_description: "An adversary may disable cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. \n\nCloud environments allow for collection\
  \ and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable logging to avoid\
  \ detection of their activities. For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity.(Citation: Following the CloudTrail: Generating\
  \ strong AWS security signals with Sumo Logic)"
