Attack_name: Hide Artifacts
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system. Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.(Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan)(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit)(Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)

  Adversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)

description: "This module extracts a binary (calc.exe) from inside of another binary. \n\nIn the wild maldoc authors will use this technique to hide binaries inside of files stored \nwithin the office document\
  \ itself. An example of this technique can be seen in sample\n\nf986040c7dd75b012e7dfd876acb33a158abf651033563ab068800f07f508226\n\nThis sample contains a document inside of itself. Document 1 is the\
  \ actual maldoc itself, document 2\nis the same document without all the malicious code. Document 1 will copy Document 2 to the file system\nand then \"peek\" inside of this document and pull out the\
  \ oleObject.bin file. Contained inside of this\noleObject.bin file is a payload that is parsed out and executed on the file system.\n"
