Attack_name: Active Setup
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Klein Active Setup 2010) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

  Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under <code> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\</code> and setting a malicious value for <code>StubPath</code>. This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Mandiant Glyer APT 2010)(Citation: Citizenlab Packrat 2015)(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: SECURELIST Bright Star 2015)(Citation: paloalto Tropic Trooper 2016)

  Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

name: HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup
tactic:
  - persistence
  - privilege-escalation
technique:
  - T1547.014
os:
  - windows
description: "This test will create an \"atomic_test\" key under 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components' to launch calc by configuring an active setup executable and \nforcing to\
  \ run active setup using the \"runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup\" command. \nWithout the \"runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup\" command it would run during the next logon for each user.\n\nNote: If\
  \ you logout before running the cleanup command, you will be required to go through the OOBE (out-of-box experience) setup sequence to log back in. \nThe payload will only run once unless the cleanup\
  \ command is run in between tests.\n\n[Active Setup Explained](https://helgeklein.com/blog/active-setup-explained/)\n"
