  \ victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095). Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools\
  \ between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)). \n\nFiles can also be transferred using various [Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)s\
  \ as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.(Citation: PTSecurity Cobalt Dec 2016)\n\nOn Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as `copy`, `finger`,\
  \ and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) commands such as <code>IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString()</code> and <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>. On Linux and macOS systems,\

description: "Uses the cmdl32 to download arbitrary file from the internet. The cmdl32 package is allowed to install the profile used to launch the VPN connection. However, the config is modified to download\
  \ the arbitary file. \nThe issue of cmdl32.exe detecting and deleting the payload by identifying it as not a VPN Servers profile is avoided by setting a temporary TMP folder and denying the delete permission\
  \ to all files for the user.\nUpon successful execution the test will open calculator and Notepad executable for 10 seconds.\nreference:\nhttps://twitter.com/ElliotKillick/status/1455897435063074824\n\
