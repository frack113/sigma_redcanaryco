Attack_name: Process Injection
Attack_description: "Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code\
  \ in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.\
  \ Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \n\nThere are many different ways to inject code into a process,\
  \ many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. \n\nMore sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections\
  \ to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel. "

name: Shellcode execution via VBA
tactic:
  - privilege-escalation
  - defense-evasion
technique:
  - T1055
os:
  - windows
description: |
  This module injects shellcode into a newly created process and executes. By default the shellcode is created,
  with Metasploit, for use on x86-64 Windows 10 machines.

  Note: Due to the way the VBA code handles memory/pointers/injection, a 64bit installation of Microsoft Office
  is required.
