Attack_name: Query Registry
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.

  The Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security.(Citation: Wikipedia Windows Registry) Information can easily be queried using the [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) utility, though other means to access the Registry exist. Some of the information may help adversaries to further their operation within a network. Adversaries may use the information from [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

description: "Query Windows Registry with Powershell cmdlets, i.e., Get-Item and Get-ChildItem. The results from above can also be achieved with Get-Item and Get-ChildItem.\nUnlike using \"reg query\" which
  then executes reg.exe, using cmdlets won't generate new processes, which may evade detection systems monitoring process generation. \n"
