Attack_name: 'Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Obfuscated Non-C2 Protocol'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate
  network location from the main command and control server.(Citation: copy_cmd_cisco)\n\nAdversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively
  unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). This may include custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as well as embedding data within protocol headers and fields. "

description: 'An adversary may use the python3 standard library module http.server to exfiltrate data. This test checks if python3 is available and if so, creates a HTTP server on port 9090, captures the
  PID, sleeps for 10 seconds, then kills the PID and unsets the $PID variable.
