Attack_name: Password Filter DLL
Attack_description: "Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated. \n\nWindows password\
  \ filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies.\
  \ Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts. Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local\
  \ Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered filter. Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation. \n\nAdversaries can register\
  \ malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password\
  \ filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.(Citation: Carnal Ownage Password Filters Sept 2013)"

description: "Uses PowerShell to install and register a password filter DLL. Requires a reboot and administrative privileges.\nThe binary in bin is https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/95140c1ad39fd632d1c1300b246293297aa272ce6035eecc3da56e337200221d/detection\n\
  Source is in src folder. \nThis does require a reboot to see the filter loaded into lsass.exe. \nIt does require Administrative privileges to import the clean registry values back into LSA, it is possible\
  \ you may have to manually do this after for cleanup.\n"
