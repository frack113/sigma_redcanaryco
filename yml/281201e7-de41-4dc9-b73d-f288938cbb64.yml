Attack_name: 'Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver'
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension.(Citation: Wikipedia Screensaver) The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in <code>C:\Windows\System32\</code>, and <code>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\</code>  on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.

  The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (<code>HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\</code>) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:

  * <code>SCRNSAVE.exe</code> - set to malicious PE path
  * <code>ScreenSaveActive</code> - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
  * <code>ScreenSaverIsSecure</code> - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
  * <code>ScreenSaveTimeout</code> - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed

  Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity.(Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)
