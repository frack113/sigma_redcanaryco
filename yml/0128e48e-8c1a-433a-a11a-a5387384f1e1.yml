Attack_name: Process Injection
Attack_description: "Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code
  in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution
  via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \n\nThere are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of
  which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. \n\nMore sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment
  modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel. "

  - windows
description: "This test exploited the vulnerability in legitimate PE formats where sections have RWX permission and enough space for shellcode.\nThe RWX injection avoided the use of VirtualAlloc, WriteVirtualMemory,
  and ProtectVirtualMemory, thus evading detection mechanisms \nthat relied on API call sequences and heuristics. The RWX injection utilises API call sequences: LoadLibrary --> GetModuleInformation -->
  GetModuleHandleA --> RtlCopyMemory --> CreateThread.\nThe injected shellcode will open a message box and a notepad.\nRWX Process Injection, also known as MockingJay, was introduced to the security community
  by SecurityJoes.\nMore details can be found at https://www.securityjoes.com/post/process-mockingjay-echoing-rwx-in-userland-to-achieve-code-execution.\nThe original injector and idea were developed for
  game cheats, as visible at https://github.com/M-r-J-o-h-n/SWH-Injector.\n"
