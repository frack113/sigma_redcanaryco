Attack_name: 'Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility'
Attack_description: "Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data
  into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.\n\nAdversaries may abuse various utilities to compress or encrypt data before exfiltration. Some third party utilities may be preinstalled, such
  as <code>tar</code> on Linux and macOS or <code>zip</code> on Windows systems. \n\nOn Windows, <code>diantz</code> or <code> makecab</code> may be used to package collected files into a cabinet (.cab)
  file. <code>diantz</code> may also be used to download and compress files from remote locations (i.e. [Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)).(Citation: diantz.exe_lolbas)
  <code>xcopy</code> on Windows can copy files and directories with a variety of options. Additionally, adversaries may use [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to Base64 encode collected
  data before exfiltration. \n\nAdversaries may use also third party utilities, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip, to perform similar activities.(Citation: 7zip Homepage)(Citation: WinRAR Homepage)(Citation:

description: "An adversary may compress all the collected data, encrypt and send them to a C2 server using base64 encoding. \nThis atomic test tries to emulate the behaviour of the FLEXIROOT backdoor to
  archive the collected data. FLEXIROOT typically utilizes AES encryption and base64 encoding to transfer the encrypted data to the C2 server. \nIn this test, standard zip compression and the OpenSSL library
  are used to encrypt the compressed data.\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/software/S0267/"
