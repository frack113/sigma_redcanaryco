Attack_name: Remote Access Software
Attack_description: "An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks. These services,
  such as `VNC`, `Team Viewer`, `AnyDesk`, `ScreenConnect`, `LogMein`, `AmmyyAdmin`, and other remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, are commonly used as legitimate technical support software and
  may be allowed by application control within a target environment.(Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)(Citation: CrowdStrike 2015 Global Threat Report)(Citation: CrySyS Blog TeamSpy)\n\nRemote access
  software may be installed and used post-compromise as an alternate communications channel for redundant access or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system. They
  may also be used as a component of malware to establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled system.\n \nAdversaries may similarly abuse response features included
  in EDR and other defensive tools that enable remote access.\n\nInstallation of many remote access software may also include persistence (e.g., the software's installation routine creates a [Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003))."
