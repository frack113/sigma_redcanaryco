Attack_name: Password Spraying
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec Password Spraying)

  Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:

  * SSH (22/TCP)
  * Telnet (23/TCP)
  * FTP (21/TCP)
  * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
  * LDAP (389/TCP)
  * Kerberos (88/TCP)
  * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
  * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
  * MSSQL (1433/TCP)
  * Oracle (1521/TCP)
  * MySQL (3306/TCP)
  * VNC (5900/TCP)

  In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018)

  In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.

description: "Perform a domain password spray using the same core method of the [DomainPasswordSpray tool](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) \nbut without all the extra code that makes the\
  \ script get blocked by many AVs. \nThis atomic test will attempt a single password against all users in a password list at $env:Temp\\usersdpsLight.txt. You can create this file manually\nor with the\
  \ automated prereq_command. The prereq_command will limit the user list to 200 users by default to help you avoid massive account lockout.\n"
