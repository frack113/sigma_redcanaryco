Attack_name: Clear Windows Event Logs
Attack_description: |-
  Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.

  The event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:

  * <code>wevtutil cl system</code>
  * <code>wevtutil cl application</code>
  * <code>wevtutil cl security</code>

  These logs may also be cleared through other mechanisms, such as the event viewer GUI or [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).
