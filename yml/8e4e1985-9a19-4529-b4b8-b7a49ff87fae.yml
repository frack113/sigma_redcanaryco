Attack_name: Rootkit
Attack_description: "Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence\
  \ of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits) \n\nRootkits or rootkit enabling functionality may reside\
  \ at the user or kernel level in the operating system or lower, to include a hypervisor, Master Boot Record, or [System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001). (Citation: Wikipedia Rootkit)\
  \ Rootkits have been seen for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X systems. (Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit) (Citation: BlackHat Mac OSX Rootkit)"

name: Windows Signed Driver Rootkit Test
tactic:
  - defense-evasion
technique:
  - T1014
os:
  - windows
description: "This test exploits a signed driver to execute code in Kernel.\nThis example was curated from a blog that utilizes puppetstrings.exe with the vulnerable (signed driver) capcom.sys. \nThe capcom.sys\
  \ driver may be found on github. A great reference is here: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/28.html\nSHA1 C1D5CF8C43E7679B782630E93F5E6420CA1749A7\nWe leverage the work done here:\nhttps://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/07/puppet-strings-dirty-secret-for-free.html\n\
  The hash of our PoC Exploit is\nSHA1 DD8DA630C00953B6D5182AA66AF999B1E117F441\nThis will simulate hiding a process.\n"
