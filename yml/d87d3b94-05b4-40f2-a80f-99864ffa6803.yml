Attack_name: 'Unsecured Credentials: Bash History'
Attack_description: 'Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history"
  utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s <code>.bash_history</code> file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: <code>~/.bash_history</code>. Typically, this
  file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries
  can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way)'
