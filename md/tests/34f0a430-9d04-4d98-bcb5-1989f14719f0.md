# Attack: Token Impersonation/Theft

 Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. An adversary can create a new access token that duplicates an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

An adversary may do this when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the new token to. For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.

# Test : `SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication

OS: ['windows']

Description: Uses PowerShell and Empire's [GetSystem module](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/v3.4.0/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1). The script uses `SeDebugPrivilege` to obtain, duplicate and impersonate the token of a another process.
When executed successfully, the test displays the domain and name of the account it's impersonating (local SYSTEM).
