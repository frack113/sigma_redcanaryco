# Attack: Disable or Modify Tools 

Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities. This can take the form of killing security software or event logging processes, deleting Registry keys so that tools do not start at run time, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information.

# Test : Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt
## OS

## Description:
Attempting to disable scheduled scanning and other parts of windows defender atp. These commands must be run as System, so they still fail as administrator.
However, adversaries do attempt to perform this action so monitoring for these command lines can help alert to other bad things going on. Upon execution, "Access Denied"
will be displayed twice and the WinDefend service status will be displayed.
