# Attack: Windows Management Instrumentation 

Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to achieve execution. WMI is a Windows administration feature that provides a uniform environment for local and remote access to Windows system components. It relies on the WMI service for local and remote access and the server message block (SMB) (Citation: Wikipedia SMB) and Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) (Citation: TechNet RPC) for remote access. RPCS operates over port 135. (Citation: MSDN WMI)

An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to perform many tactic functions, such as gathering information for Discovery and remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. (Citation: FireEye WMI SANS 2015) (Citation: FireEye WMI 2015)

# MITRE
## Tactic
  - execution


## technique
  - T1047


# Test : Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
Solarigate persistence is achieved via backdoors deployed via various techniques including using PowerShell with an EncodedCommand
 Powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand <encoded command>
Where the –EncodedCommand, once decoded, would resemble:
  Invoke-WMIMethod win32_process -name create -argumentlist ‘rundll32 c:\windows\idmu\common\ypprop.dll _XInitImageFuncPtrs’ -ComputerName WORKSTATION
The EncodedCommand in this atomic is the following: Invoke-WmiMethod -Path win32_process -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe
You should expect to see notepad.exe running after execution of this test.
