# Attack: System Service Discovery

 Adversaries may try to get information about registered services. Commands that may obtain information about services using operating system utilities are "sc," "tasklist /svc" using [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), and "net start" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039), but adversaries may also use other tools as well. Adversaries may use the information from [System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

# Test : System Service Discovery - net.exe

OS: ['windows']

Description:

 Enumerates started system services using net.exe and writes them to a file. This technique has been used by multiple threat actors.

Upon successful execution, net.exe will run from cmd.exe that queries services. Expected output is to a txt file in c:\Windows\Temp\service-list.txt.s
