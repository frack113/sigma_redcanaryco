# Attack: Remote System Discovery 

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as  [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or <code>net view</code> using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Adversaries may also use local host files (ex: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. 

Specific to macOS, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol exists to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain.

# MITRE
## Tactic
  - discovery


## technique
  - T1018


# Test : Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
This tool enables enumeration and exporting of all DNS records in the zone for recon purposes of internal networks
Python 3 and adidnsdump must be installed, use the get_prereq_command's to meet the prerequisites for this test.
Successful execution of this test will list dns zones in the terminal.
