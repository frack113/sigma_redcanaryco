# Attack: Network Share Connection Removal 

Adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation. Windows shared drive and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) connections can be removed when no longer needed. [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the <code>net use \\system\share /delete</code> command.

# Test : Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
Administrative shares are hidden network shares created by Microsoftâ€™s Windows NT operating systems that grant system administrators 
remote access to every disk volume on a network-connected system. These shares are automatically created at started unless they have been
purposefully disabled and is done in this Atomic test. As Microsoft puts it, "Missing administrative shares typically 
indicate that the computer in question has been compromised by malicious software."
