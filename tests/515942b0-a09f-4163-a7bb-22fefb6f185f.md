# Attack: Network Service Scanning

 Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system. 

Within cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts. Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running on non-cloud systems as well.

# Test : Port Scan Nmap

OS: ['linux', 'macos']

Description: Scan ports to check for listening ports with Nmap.

Upon successful execution, sh will utilize nmap, telnet, and nc to contact a single or range of adresseses on port 80 to determine if listening. Results will be via stdout.
