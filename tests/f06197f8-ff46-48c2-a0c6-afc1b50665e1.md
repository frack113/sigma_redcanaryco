# Attack: Software Packing 

Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.(Citation: ESET FinFisher Jan 2018) 

Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, (Citation: Wikipedia Exe Compression) but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.  

# MITRE
## Tactic
  - defense-evasion


## technique
  - T1027.002


# Test : Binary packed by UPX, with modified headers (linux)
## OS
  - linux


## Description:
Copies and then runs a simple binary (just outputting "the cake is a lie"), that was packed by UPX.

The UPX magic number (`0x55505821`, "`UPX!`") was changed to (`0x4c4f5452`, "`LOTR`"). This prevents the binary from being detected
by some methods, and especially UPX is not able to uncompress it any more.
