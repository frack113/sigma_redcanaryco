# Attack: Query Registry 

Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.

The Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security.(Citation: Wikipedia Windows Registry) Information can easily be queried using the [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) utility, though other means to access the Registry exist. Some of the information may help adversaries to further their operation within a network. Adversaries may use the information from [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

# Test : Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
This test is designed to enumerate the COM objects listed in HKCR, then output their methods and CLSIDs to a text file.
An adversary could then use this information to identify COM objects that might be vulnerable to abuse, such as using them to spawn arbitrary processes.
