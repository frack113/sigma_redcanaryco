# Attack: OS Credential Dumping

 Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software. Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and access restricted information.

Several of the tools mentioned in associated sub-techniques may be used by both adversaries and professional security testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.


# MITRE
## Tactic
  - credential-access

## technique
  - T1003

# Test : Gsecdump

## OS

 ['windows']

## Description:

 Dump credentials from memory using Gsecdump.

Upon successful execution, you should see domain\username's following by two 32 characters hashes.

If you see output that says "compat: error: failed to create child process", execution was likely blocked by Anti-Virus. 
You will receive only error output if you do not run this test from an elevated context (run as administrator)

If you see a message saying "The system cannot find the path specified", try using the get-prereq_commands to download and install Gsecdump first.
