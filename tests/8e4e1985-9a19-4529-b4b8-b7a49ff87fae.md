# Attack: Rootkit

 Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits) 

Rootkits or rootkit enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system or lower, to include a hypervisor, Master Boot Record, or [System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001). (Citation: Wikipedia Rootkit) Rootkits have been seen for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X systems. (Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit) (Citation: BlackHat Mac OSX Rootkit)

# Test : Windows Signed Driver Rootkit Test

OS: ['windows']

Description: This test exploits a signed driver to execute code in Kernel.
This example was curated from a blog that utilizes puppetstrings.exe with the vulnerable (signed driver) capcom.sys. 
The capcom.sys driver may be found on github. A great reference is here: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/28.html
SHA1 C1D5CF8C43E7679B782630E93F5E6420CA1749A7
We leverage the work done here:
https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/07/puppet-strings-dirty-secret-for-free.html
The hash of our PoC Exploit is
SHA1 DD8DA630C00953B6D5182AA66AF999B1E117F441
This will simulate hiding a process.
