# Attack: Unsecured Credentials 

Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. [Bash History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. [Credentials in Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)).

# Test : AWS - Retrieve EC2 Password Data using stratus
## OS
  - linux
  - macos
  - iaas:aws


## Description:
This atomic runs an API call GetPasswordData from a role that does not have permission to do so. This simulates an attacker attempting to retrieve RDP passwords on a high number of Windows EC2 instances. This atomic test leverages a tool called stratus-red-team built by DataDog (https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team). Stratus Red Team is a self-contained binary. You can use it to easily detonate offensive attack techniques against a live cloud environment.
