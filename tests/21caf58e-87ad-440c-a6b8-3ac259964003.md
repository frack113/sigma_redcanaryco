# Attack: Encrypted Channel 

Adversaries may employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.

# MITRE
## Tactic
  - command-and-control


## technique
  - T1573


# Test : OpenSSL C2
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
Thanks to @OrOneEqualsOne for this quick C2 method.
This is to test to see if a C2 session can be established using an SSL socket.
More information about this technique, including how to set up the listener, can be found here:
