# Attack: OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager 

Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the <code>net user</code> command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.

A number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:

* pwdumpx.exe
* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)
* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)
* secretsdump.py

Alternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:

* <code>reg save HKLM\sam sam</code>
* <code>reg save HKLM\system system</code>

Creddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.(Citation: GitHub Creddump7)

Notes: 

* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.
* RID 501 is the guest account.
* User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.

# Test : Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
Local SAM (SAM & System), cached credentials (System & Security) and LSA secrets (System & Security) can be enumerated
via three registry keys. Then processed locally using https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7

Upon successful execution of this test, you will find three files named, sam, system and security in the %temp% directory.
