# Attack: Remote System Discovery 

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as  [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or <code>net view</code> using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Adversaries may also use local host files (ex: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. 

Specific to macOS, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol exists to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain.

# Test : Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
This test is a Powershell script that enumerates Active Directory to determine computers that are joined to the domain. 
This test is designed to mimic how SessionGopher can determine the additional systems within a domain, which has been used before by threat actors to aid in lateral movement. 
Reference: [Head Fake: Tackling Disruptive Ransomware Attacks](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/head-fake-tackling-disruptive-ransomware-attacks). 
Upon successful execution, this test will output the names of the computers that reside on the domain to the console window.
