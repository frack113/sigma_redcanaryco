# Attack: System Service Discovery 

Adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system services. Adversaries may obtain information about services using tools as well as OS utility commands such as <code>sc query</code>, <code>tasklist /svc</code>, <code>systemctl --type=service</code>, and <code>net start</code>.

Adversaries may use the information from [System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

## technique
  - T1007


# Test : System Service Discovery - net.exe
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
Enumerates started system services using net.exe and writes them to a file. This technique has been used by multiple threat actors.

Upon successful execution, net.exe will run from cmd.exe that queries services. Expected output is to a txt file in in the temp directory called service-list.txt.
