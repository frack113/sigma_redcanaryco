# Attack: Remote System Discovery 

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as  [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or <code>net view</code> using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Adversaries may also use local host files (ex: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. 


# MITRE
## Tactic
  - discovery


## technique
  - T1018


# Test : Remote System Discovery - nslookup
## OS
  - windows


## Description:
Powershell script that runs nslookup on cmd.exe against the local /24 network of the first network adaptor listed in ipconfig.

Upon successful execution, powershell will identify the ip range (via ipconfig) and perform a for loop and execute nslookup against that IP range. Output will be via stdout.


## Executor
powershell
