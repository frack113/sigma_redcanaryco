# Attack: Python 

Adversaries may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution. Python is a very popular scripting/programming language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line (via the <code>python.exe</code> interpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems. Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.

Python comes with many built-in packages to interact with the underlying system, such as file operations and device I/O. Adversaries can use these libraries to download and execute commands or other scripts as well as perform various malicious behaviors.

## technique
  - T1059.006


# Test : Python pty module and spawn function used to spawn sh or bash
## OS
  - linux


## Description:
Uses the Python spawn function to spawn a sh shell followed by a bash shell. Per Volexity, this technique was observed in exploitation of Atlassian Confluence [CVE-2022-26134]. Reference: https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence


## Executor
