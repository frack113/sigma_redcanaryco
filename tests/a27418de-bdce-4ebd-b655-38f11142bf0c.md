# Attack: Disable Cloud Logs 

An adversary may disable cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. 

Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable logging to avoid detection of their activities. For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity.(Citation: Following the CloudTrail: Generating strong AWS security signals with Sumo Logic)

# Test : AWS - Disable CloudTrail Logging Through Event Selectors using Stratus
## OS
  - linux
  - macos


## Description:
Update event selectors in AWS CloudTrail to disable the logging of certain management events to evade defense. This Atomic test leverages a tool called Stratus-Red-Team built by DataDog (https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team). Stratus Red Team is a self-contained binary. You can use it to easily detonate offensive attack techniques against a live cloud environment.
