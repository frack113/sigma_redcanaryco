# Attack: System Network Configuration Discovery 

Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), [ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0101), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and [route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103).

Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to gather information about configurations and settings, such as IP addresses of configured interfaces and static/dynamic routes (e.g. <code>show ip route</code>, <code>show ip interface</code>).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: Mandiant APT41 Global Intrusion )

Adversaries may use the information from [System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do next.

# Test : List macOS Firewall Rules
## OS
  - macos


## Description:
"This will test if the macOS firewall is enabled and/or show what rules are configured. Must be run with elevated privileges. Upon successful execution, these commands will output various information about the firewall configuration, including status and specific port/protocol blocks or allows. 

Using `defaults`, additional arguments can be added to see filtered details, such as `globalstate` for global configuration (\"Is it on or off?\"), `firewall` for common application allow rules, and `explicitauths` for specific rules configured by the user. 

Using `socketfilterfw`, flags such as --getglobalstate or --listapps can be used for similar filtering. At least one flag is required to send parseable output to standard out.
